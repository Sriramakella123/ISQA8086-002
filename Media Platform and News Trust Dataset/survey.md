# Media Platform & News Trust Survey — January 2017

This survey contains data that needs to be analyzed from the  supporting BuzzFeed News article, "[Most American Adults Get News From Facebook — But They Don’t Really Trust It, A New Survey Says](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/people-be-reading-but-not-trusting-news-on-facebook)," published January 19, 2017.

## Data
The data set is interesting in order to know the behaviour and trust of social media news on the peple, which can be obtained through the survey and understand the sources of data people rely on and how it effects the thought process in daily life activities.
